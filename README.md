## The Repository

This repository is a fork of [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) where we (Conscendo) develop the Salesforce Intelligence Integrated Development product together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our roadmap, monthly iteration plans, and endgame plans.

Salesforce Intelligence Integrated Development (siid) is a specialized distribution based on the `Code - OSS` repository, customized for Salesforce development workflows and intelligence features.

siid combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools - specifically optimized for Salesforce development.

## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions live in their own repositories on GitHub. This project builds upon the extensive VS Code ecosystem. For the original VS Code related projects, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page.

## Bundled Extensions

siid includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/sfdxpert/AIpexium2) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
